# 🎓 CS50 Python Programming Projects 🐍

Welcome to my CS50 Python Programming journey! This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Harvard University's CS50 Python course.

## 📚 Projects

### Vanity Plates 🚗

#### 📂 Location
`problem set 2/vanity_plates/plates.py`

#### 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create a program that validates vanity license plates according to specific rules.

#### 📝 Description
This program prompts the user for a vanity plate and then outputs whether it's valid or invalid based on Massachusetts' requirements. It demonstrates string manipulation, conditional logic, and input validation in Python.

#### 🔑 Key Features
- Prompts the user for a vanity plate input
- Validates the plate against the following rules:
  - Must start with at least two letters
  - Can contain 2-6 characters (letters or numbers)
  - Numbers must come at the end, and the first number can't be '0'
  - No periods, spaces, or punctuation marks allowed
- Outputs "Valid" or "Invalid" based on the input

#### 🖥️ How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "problem set 2/vanity_plates"
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   python plates.py
   ```
3. Enter a vanity plate when prompted
4. See if your plate is valid or invalid!

#### 🧪 Testing
You can test the program with various inputs:
- Try "CS50" → should output "Valid"
- Try "CS05" → should output "Invalid"
- Try "CS50P" → should output "Invalid"
- Try "PI3.14" → should output "Invalid"
- Try "H" → should output "Invalid"
- Try "OUTATIME" → should output "Invalid"

#### 💡 What I Learned
- String manipulation and validation in Python
- Implementing complex conditional logic
- Breaking down problems into smaller, manageable parts
- Writing modular code with separate functions for validation

#### 🏆 Achievements
This project passed all tests from `check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/plates`, demonstrating its correctness and adherence to the project specifications.
