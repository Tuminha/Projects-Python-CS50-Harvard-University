# 🎓 CS50 Python Programming Projects 🐍

Welcome to my CS50 Python Programming journey! This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Harvard University's CS50 Python course.

## 📚 Projects

### camelCase to snake_case Converter 🐫➡️🐍

#### 📂 Location
`problem set 2/camelCase/camel.py`

#### 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create a program that converts variable names from camelCase to snake_case.

#### 📝 Description
This program prompts the user for a variable name in camelCase and outputs the corresponding name in snake_case. It demonstrates string manipulation and case conversion in Python.

#### 🔑 Key Features
- Prompts the user for a variable name in camelCase
- Converts the input from camelCase to snake_case
- Handles multi-word variable names correctly
- Outputs the result in snake_case format

#### 🖥️ How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "problem set 2/camelCase"
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   python camel.py
   ```
3. Enter a variable name in camelCase when prompted
4. See the snake_case conversion!

#### 🧪 Testing
You can test the program with various inputs:
- Try "name" → should output "name"
- Try "firstName" → should output "first_name"
- Try "preferredFirstName" → should output "preferred_first_name"

#### 💡 What I Learned
- String manipulation in Python
- Converting between different naming conventions
- Implementing case-sensitive logic
- Handling user input and output formatting

#### 🏆 Achievements
This project passed all tests from `check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/camel`, demonstrating its correctness and adherence to the project specifications.
