# 🎓 CS50 Python Programming Projects 🐍

Welcome to my CS50 Python Programming journey! This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Harvard University's CS50 Python course.

## 📚 Projects

### Nutrition Facts 🍎🥑🍌

#### 📂 Location
`problem set 2/nutrition_facts/nutrition.py`

#### 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create a program that provides calorie information for various fruits based on FDA data.

#### 📝 Description
This program prompts the user to input a fruit name and then outputs the number of calories in one portion of that fruit, according to the FDA's nutrition information poster. It demonstrates dictionary usage, case-insensitive input handling, and data lookup in Python.

#### 🔑 Key Features
- Prompts the user for a fruit name input
- Handles case-insensitive input
- Looks up calorie information in a predefined dictionary
- Outputs the calorie count for the specified fruit
- Ignores input that isn't a recognized fruit

#### 🖥️ How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "problem set 2/nutrition_facts"
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   python nutrition.py
   ```
3. Enter a fruit name when prompted
4. See the calorie information for that fruit!

#### 🧪 Testing
You can test the program with various inputs:
- Try "Apple" → should output "Calories: 130"
- Try "avocado" → should output "Calories: 50"
- Try "Sweet Cherries" → should output "Calories: 100"
- Try "Tomato" → should output nothing (not in the fruit list)

#### 💡 What I Learned
- Working with dictionaries in Python
- Handling case-insensitive input
- Implementing data lookup functionality
- Error handling for invalid inputs

#### 🏆 Achievements
This project passed all tests from `check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/nutrition`, demonstrating its correctness and adherence to the project specifications.
