# 🎓 CS50 Python Programming Projects 🐍

Welcome to my CS50 Python Programming journey! This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Harvard University's CS50 Python course.

## 📚 Projects

### Coke Machine 🥤

#### 📂 Location
`problem set 2/coke_machine/coke.py`

#### 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create a program that simulates a Coke vending machine, accepting coins and calculating change.

#### 📝 Description
This program prompts the user to insert coins one at a time, informing them of the amount due after each insertion. Once the user has inserted at least 50 cents, it outputs the change owed. The program demonstrates loop usage, conditional statements, and basic arithmetic operations in Python.

#### 🔑 Key Features
- Prompts the user to insert coins (25, 10, or 5 cents)
- Calculates and displays the remaining amount due after each insertion
- Handles invalid coin denominations
- Calculates and displays the change owed when the full amount is paid
- Uses a loop to continue prompting until the full amount is received

#### 🖥️ How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "problem set 2/coke_machine"
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   python coke.py
   ```
3. Insert coins as prompted
4. See the amount due update and eventually the change owed!

#### 🧪 Testing
You can test the program with various inputs:
- Try inserting 25 cents → should output "Amount Due: 25"
- Try inserting 10 cents → should output "Amount Due: 40"
- Try inserting an invalid amount like 30 cents → should re-prompt with "Amount Due: 50"
- Insert coins until you reach or exceed 50 cents → should output "Change Owed: X" where X is the change amount

#### 💡 What I Learned
- Implementing loops for continuous user input
- Handling different coin denominations
- Calculating running totals and change
- Input validation and error handling

#### 🏆 Achievements
This project passed all tests from `check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/coke`, demonstrating its correctness and adherence to the project specifications.
