# 🎓 CS50 Python Programming Projects 🐍

Welcome to my CS50 Python Programming journey! This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Harvard University's CS50 Python course.

## 📚 Projects

### Just Setting Up My Twttr 🐦

#### 📂 Location
`problem set 2/just_setting_up_my_twttr/twttr.py`

#### 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create a program that removes vowels from a given text, simulating the shortening of words often used in texting or tweeting.

#### 📝 Description
This program prompts the user for a string of text and then outputs the same text with all vowels (A, E, I, O, and U) omitted, regardless of whether they were inputted in uppercase or lowercase. It demonstrates string manipulation and character filtering in Python.

#### 🔑 Key Features
- Prompts the user for input text
- Removes all vowels (both uppercase and lowercase) from the input
- Preserves all other characters, including spaces and punctuation
- Outputs the modified text

#### 🖥️ How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "problem set 2/just_setting_up_my_twttr"
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   python twttr.py
   ```
3. Enter your text when prompted
4. See the vowel-free version of your text!

#### 🧪 Testing
You can test the program with various inputs:
- Try "Twitter" → should output "Twttr"
- Try "What's your name?" → should output "Wht's yr nm?"
- Try "CS50" → should output "CS50"
- Try "PYTHON" → should output "PYTHN"

#### 💡 What I Learned
- String manipulation in Python
- Working with character sets (vowels)
- Case-insensitive string operations
- Implementing a character filter

#### 🏆 Achievements
This project passed all tests from `check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/twttr`, demonstrating its correctness and adherence to the project specifications.
