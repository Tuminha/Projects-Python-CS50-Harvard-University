# 🎓 CS50 Python Programming Projects 🐍

Welcome to my CS50 Python Programming journey! This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Harvard University's CS50 Python course.

## 📚 Projects

### Adieu, Adieu 👋

#### 📂 Location
`problem set 4/adieu_adieu/adieu.py`

#### 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create a program that bids farewell to a list of names in a grammatically correct format, inspired by "The Sound of Music."

#### 📝 Description
This program prompts the user to input names, one per line, until the user signals the end of input (using control-d). It then outputs a farewell message to all the names, formatting the list according to English grammar rules. The project demonstrates list manipulation, string formatting, and handling user input in Python.

#### 🔑 Key Features
- Continuously prompts for names until the user ends input
- Handles lists of any length (minimum one name)
- Formats the output with correct grammar:
  - Two names: separated by "and"
  - Three or more names: comma-separated with "and" before the last name
- Uses the inflect library for proper list formatting

#### 🖥️ How to Run
1. Install the required library:
   ```
   pip install inflect
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "problem set 4/adieu_adieu"
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```
   python adieu.py
   ```
4. Enter names, one per line
5. Press control-d to end input and see the farewell message

#### 🧪 Testing
You can test the program with various inputs:
- Try entering "Liesl" and press control-d
- Try entering "Liesl", "Friedrich", and press control-d
- Try entering "Liesl", "Friedrich", "Louisa", "Kurt", "Brigitta", and press control-d

#### 💡 What I Learned
- Handling continuous user input
- List manipulation in Python
- String formatting for grammatically correct output
- Using external libraries (inflect) for text processing
- Implementing EOF (End of File) detection in user input

#### 🏆 Achievements
This project passed all tests from `check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/adieu`, demonstrating its correctness and adherence to the project specifications.
