# 🎓 CS50 Python Programming Projects 🐍

Welcome to my CS50 Python Programming journey! This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Harvard University's CS50 Python course.

## 📚 Projects

### Little Professor 🧮

#### 📂 Location
`problem set 4/little_professor/professor.py`

#### 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create a program that simulates the "Little Professor" toy, generating math problems for the user to solve.

#### 📝 Description
This program prompts the user for a difficulty level, then generates 10 addition problems. It keeps track of the user's score and allows up to three attempts per problem. The program demonstrates random number generation, user input handling, and score tracking in Python.

#### 🔑 Key Features
- Prompts user for a difficulty level (1, 2, or 3)
- Generates 10 random addition problems based on the chosen level
- Allows up to three attempts per problem
- Displays "EEE" for incorrect answers
- Shows the correct answer after three failed attempts
- Tracks and displays the user's final score

#### 🖥️ How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "problem set 4/little_professor"
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   python professor.py
   ```
3. Enter a difficulty level when prompted
4. Solve the math problems!

#### 🧪 Testing
You can test the program with various inputs:
- Try different difficulty levels (1, 2, 3)
- Attempt to enter invalid difficulty levels
- Answer questions correctly and incorrectly
- Let the program show you the correct answer after three attempts

#### 💡 What I Learned
- Generating random numbers within specific ranges
- Implementing a retry mechanism for incorrect answers
- Using functions to structure code logically
- Handling user input and validating it
- Tracking scores and attempts

#### 🏆 Achievements
This project passed all tests from `check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/professor`, demonstrating its correctness and adherence to the project specifications.
