# 🎓 CS50 Python Programming Projects 🐍

Welcome to my CS50 Python Programming journey! This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Harvard University's CS50 Python course.

## 📚 Projects

### Bitcoin Price Index 💰

#### 📂 Location
`problem set 4/bitcoin_price_index/bitcoin.py`

#### 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create a program that calculates the current cost of Bitcoin based on user input and real-time price data.

#### 📝 Description
This program takes a command-line argument for the number of Bitcoins a user wants to buy, fetches the current Bitcoin price from the CoinDesk API, and calculates the total cost in USD. It demonstrates working with APIs, JSON data, and command-line arguments in Python.

#### 🔑 Key Features
- Accepts a command-line argument for the number of Bitcoins
- Fetches real-time Bitcoin price data from the CoinDesk API
- Handles potential errors in user input and API requests
- Calculates and displays the total cost in USD with proper formatting

#### 🖥️ How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "problem set 4/bitcoin_price_index"
   ```
2. Run the program with a number of Bitcoins as an argument:
   ```
   python bitcoin.py 2.5
   ```

#### 🧪 Testing
You can test the program with various inputs:
- Try different numbers of Bitcoins (e.g., 1, 2, 2.5)
- Attempt to run without an argument or with non-numeric arguments
- Check if the program handles API request errors gracefully

#### 💡 What I Learned
- Working with command-line arguments using `sys.argv`
- Making HTTP requests to APIs using the `requests` library
- Parsing JSON data from API responses
- Handling exceptions for both user input and network requests
- Formatting currency output in Python

#### 🏆 Achievements
This project passed all tests from `check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/bitcoin`, demonstrating its correctness and adherence to the project specifications.
