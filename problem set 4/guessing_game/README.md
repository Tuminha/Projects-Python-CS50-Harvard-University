# 🎓 CS50 Python Programming Projects 🐍

Welcome to my CS50 Python Programming journey! This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Harvard University's CS50 Python course.

## 📚 Projects

### Guessing Game 🎲

#### 📂 Location
`problem set 4/guessing_game/game.py`

#### 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create a number guessing game where the user tries to guess a randomly generated number within a specified range.

#### 📝 Description
This program prompts the user for a level (which sets the upper bound for the random number), generates a random number within that range, and then allows the user to guess the number. It provides feedback on each guess and continues until the correct number is guessed.

#### 🔑 Key Features
- Prompts for a positive integer as the level
- Generates a random number between 1 and the specified level
- Handles invalid inputs for both level and guesses
- Provides feedback on each guess (Too small!, Too large!, or Just right!)
- Continues until the correct number is guessed

#### 🖥️ How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "problem set 4/guessing_game"
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   python game.py
   ```
3. Enter a positive integer for the level when prompted
4. Start guessing numbers!

#### 🧪 Testing
You can test the program with various inputs:
- Try entering non-integer values for the level
- Try entering negative numbers for the level
- Try guessing numbers outside the specified range
- Try guessing until you get the correct number

#### 💡 What I Learned
- Using the random module to generate random numbers
- Implementing input validation and error handling
- Creating an interactive game loop
- Using conditional statements for game logic
- Proper program exit using sys.exit()

#### 🏆 Achievements
This project passed all tests from `check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/game`, demonstrating its correctness and adherence to the project specifications.
