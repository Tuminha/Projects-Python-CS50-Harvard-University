# 🎓 CS50 Python Programming Projects 🐍

Welcome to my CS50 Python Programming journey! This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Harvard University's CS50 Python course.

## 📚 Projects

### Emojize 😃

#### 📂 Location
`problem set 4/emojize/emojize.py`

#### 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create a program that converts text-based emoji codes or aliases into their corresponding emoji characters.

#### 📝 Description
This program prompts the user for a string in English and then outputs the "emojized" version of that string, converting any emoji codes or aliases to their corresponding emoji. It demonstrates the use of external libraries and string manipulation in Python.

#### 🔑 Key Features
- Prompts the user for input text
- Converts emoji codes and aliases to actual emoji characters
- Uses the `emoji` library for conversion
- Handles both standard emoji codes and aliases
- Outputs the emojized version of the input text

#### 🖥️ How to Run
1. Install the required library:
   ```
   pip install emoji
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "problem set 4/emojize"
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```
   python emojize.py
   ```
4. Enter text with emoji codes when prompted
5. See the emojized output!

#### 🧪 Testing
You can test the program with various inputs:
- Try ":1st_place_medal:" → should output "🥇"
- Try ":money_bag:" → should output "💰"
- Try ":smile_cat:" → should output "😸"
- Try "Hello, world :wave:" → should output "Hello, world 👋"

#### 💡 What I Learned
- Using external libraries in Python
- String manipulation and conversion
- Handling user input and output
- Working with emoji in Python programs

#### 🏆 Achievements
This project passed all tests from `check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/emojize`, demonstrating its correctness and adherence to the project specifications.
