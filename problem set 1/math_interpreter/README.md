# 🎓 CS50 Python Programming Projects 🐍

Welcome to my CS50 Python Programming journey! This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Harvard University's CS50 Python course.

## 📚 Projects

### Math Interpreter 🧮

#### 📂 Location
`problem set 1/math_interpreter/interpreter.py`

#### 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create a program that interprets and calculates simple arithmetic expressions input by the user.

#### 📝 Description
This program prompts the user for an arithmetic expression and calculates the result, outputting it as a floating-point value formatted to one decimal place. It demonstrates string parsing, arithmetic operations, and basic error handling in Python.

#### 🔑 Key Features
- Prompts the user for an arithmetic expression
- Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Handles integer inputs for operands
- Outputs the result as a floating-point value with one decimal place
- Basic error handling for invalid operators

#### 🖥️ How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "problem set 1/math_interpreter"
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   python interpreter.py
   ```
3. Enter an arithmetic expression when prompted (e.g., "1 + 1")
4. See the calculated result!

#### 🧪 Testing
You can test the program with various inputs:
- Try "1 + 1" → should output "2.0"
- Try "2 - 3" → should output "-1.0"
- Try "2 * 2" → should output "4.0"
- Try "50 / 5" → should output "10.0"
- Try "3 / 2" → should output "1.5"

#### 💡 What I Learned
- Parsing user input strings in Python
- Performing arithmetic operations based on user input
- Handling different operators with conditional statements
- Formatting output to specified decimal places

#### 🏆 Achievements
This project passed all tests from `check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/interpreter`, demonstrating its correctness and adherence to the project specifications.
