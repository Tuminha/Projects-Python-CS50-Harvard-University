# 🎓 CS50 Python Programming Projects 🐍

Welcome to my CS50 Python Programming journey! This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Harvard University's CS50 Python course.

## 📚 Projects

### File Extensions 📁🔍

#### 📂 Location
`problem set 1/file_extensions/extensions.py`

#### 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create a program that determines the media type of a file based on its extension.

#### 📝 Description
This program prompts the user for a file name and outputs the corresponding media type based on the file's extension. It demonstrates string manipulation, conditional logic, and handling of file extensions in Python.

#### 🔑 Key Features
- Prompts the user for a file name
- Handles case-insensitive file extensions
- Supports multiple file types: .gif, .jpg, .jpeg, .png, .pdf, .txt, .zip
- Outputs the correct media type for each supported extension
- Returns 'application/octet-stream' for unsupported or missing extensions

#### 🖥️ How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "problem set 1/file_extensions"
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   python extensions.py
   ```
3. Enter a file name when prompted
4. See the corresponding media type!

#### 🧪 Testing
You can test the program with various inputs:
- Try "happy.jpg" → should output "image/jpeg"
- Try "document.PDF" → should output "application/pdf"
- Try "script.py" → should output "application/octet-stream"
- Try various casings and leading/trailing spaces to ensure it works as expected

#### 💡 What I Learned
- Handling file extensions in Python
- Case-insensitive string comparisons
- Implementing multiple conditions efficiently
- Understanding media types and their importance in web development

#### 🏆 Achievements
This project passed all tests from `check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/extensions`, demonstrating its correctness and adherence to the project specifications.
