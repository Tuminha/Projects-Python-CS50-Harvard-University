# 🎓 CS50 Python Programming Projects 🐍

Welcome to my CS50 Python Programming journey! This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Harvard University's CS50 Python course.

## 📚 Projects

### Meal Time 🍳🍽️🌙

#### 📂 Location
`problem set 1/meal_time/meal.py`

#### 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create a program that determines the appropriate meal based on the time input by the user.

#### 📝 Description
This program prompts the user for a time and outputs whether it's breakfast time, lunch time, or dinner time. It demonstrates time conversion, conditional logic, and function usage in Python.

#### 🔑 Key Features
- Prompts the user for a time input
- Converts the input time to a float representation of hours
- Determines the appropriate meal based on the time
- Supports 24-hour time format
- Handles edge cases and times outside of meal times

#### 🖥️ How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "problem set 1/meal_time"
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   python meal.py
   ```
3. Enter a time when prompted (e.g., "7:30" or "18:45")
4. See what meal time it is!

#### 🧪 Testing
You can test the program with various inputs:
- Try "7:00" → should output "breakfast time"
- Try "12:30" → should output "lunch time"
- Try "18:45" → should output "dinner time"
- Try "11:11" → should output nothing (not a meal time)

#### 💡 What I Learned
- Converting time strings to numerical representations
- Using functions to organize code
- Implementing conditional logic for time ranges
- Handling user input and output formatting

#### 🏆 Achievements
This project passed all tests from `check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/meal`, demonstrating its correctness and adherence to the project specifications.
