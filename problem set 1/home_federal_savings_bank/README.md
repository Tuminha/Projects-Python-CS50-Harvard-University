# 🎓 CS50 Python Programming Projects 🐍

Welcome to my CS50 Python Programming journey! This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Harvard University's CS50 Python course.

## 📚 Projects

### Home Federal Savings Bank 🏦💰

#### 📂 Location
`problem set 1/home_federal_savings_bank/bank.py`

#### 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create a program that determines a reward amount based on a user's greeting, inspired by a Seinfeld episode.

#### 📝 Description
This program prompts the user for a greeting and determines a reward amount based on the greeting's content. It demonstrates string manipulation, conditional logic, and case-insensitive comparisons in Python.

#### 🔑 Key Features
- Prompts the user for a greeting
- Ignores leading whitespace in the user's input
- Performs case-insensitive comparison
- Outputs different reward amounts based on the greeting:
  - $0 if the greeting starts with "hello"
  - $20 if the greeting starts with "h" (but not "hello")
  - $100 for any other greeting

#### 🖥️ How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "problem set 1/home_federal_savings_bank"
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   python bank.py
   ```
3. Enter your greeting when prompted
4. See how much you've won!

#### 🧪 Testing
You can test the program with various inputs:
- Try "Hello" → should output "$0"
- Try "Hey there!" → should output "$20"
- Try "What's up?" → should output "$100"
- Try various casings and leading spaces to ensure it works as expected

#### 💡 What I Learned
- String manipulation in Python
- Case-insensitive comparisons
- Handling leading whitespace
- Implementing more complex conditional logic
- Creating an interactive program based on pop culture references

#### 🤓 Fun Fact
This exercise is based on a scene from Seinfeld (Season 7, Episode 24) where Kramer visits a bank with an unusual greeting policy. It's a great example of how programming can be both fun and relatable!
