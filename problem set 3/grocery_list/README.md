# 🎓 CS50 Python Programming Projects 🐍

Welcome to my CS50 Python Programming journey! This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Harvard University's CS50 Python course.

## 📚 Projects

### Grocery List 🛒

#### 📂 Location
`problem set 3/grocery_list/grocery.py`

#### 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create a program that helps users create a sorted grocery list with item counts.

#### 📝 Description
This program prompts the user to input grocery items one at a time. It then outputs a sorted list of unique items in uppercase, with each item prefixed by the number of times it was entered. The program demonstrates list manipulation, sorting, and case-insensitive string handling in Python.

#### 🔑 Key Features
- Continuously prompts the user for grocery items
- Handles case-insensitive input
- Sorts items alphabetically
- Counts occurrences of each item
- Outputs a formatted list with item counts
- Ends input when the user presses control-d (EOF)

#### 🖥️ How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "problem set 3/grocery_list"
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   python grocery.py
   ```
3. Enter grocery items, one per line
4. Press control-d to finish the list and see the output

#### 🧪 Testing
You can test the program with various inputs:
- Try "mango" and "strawberry" → should output "1 MANGO" and "1 STRAWBERRY"
- Try "milk" twice → should output "2 MILK"
- Try "tortilla" and "sweet potato" → should output "1 SWEET POTATO" and "1 TORTILLA"
- Try items with different casings → should treat them as the same item

#### 💡 What I Learned
- Working with lists and sets in Python
- Sorting and counting list items
- Handling case-insensitive input
- Catching EOFError for input termination
- Formatting output strings

#### 🏆 Achievements
This project passed all tests from `check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/grocery`, demonstrating its correctness and adherence to the project specifications.
