# 🎓 CS50 Python Programming Projects 🐍

Welcome to my CS50 Python Programming journey! This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Harvard University's CS50 Python course.

## 📚 Projects

### Outdated 📅

#### 📂 Location
`problem set 3/outdated/outdated.py`

#### 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create a program that converts dates from various formats to the ISO 8601 standard format (YYYY-MM-DD).

#### 📝 Description
This program prompts the user for a date in month-day-year order, either in the format "9/8/1636" or "September 8, 1636". It then converts and outputs the date in the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD). The program demonstrates date parsing, string manipulation, and error handling in Python.

#### 🔑 Key Features
- Accepts dates in two formats: numeric (MM/DD/YYYY) and word-based (Month DD, YYYY)
- Converts dates to the ISO 8601 format (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Handles invalid date inputs by reprompting the user
- Supports a list of month names for word-based input
- Implements error checking for invalid dates (e.g., out of range months or days)

#### 🖥️ How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "problem set 3/outdated"
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   python outdated.py
   ```
3. Enter a date when prompted
4. See the date converted to ISO 8601 format!

#### 🧪 Testing
You can test the program with various inputs:
- Try "9/8/1636" → should output "1636-09-08"
- Try "September 8, 1636" → should output "1636-09-08"
- Try "23/6/1912" → should reprompt (invalid date)
- Try "December 80, 1980" → should reprompt (invalid date)

#### 💡 What I Learned
- Parsing and manipulating date strings
- Handling multiple input formats
- Implementing robust error checking
- Using lists for data validation (month names)
- Formatting output strings

#### 🏆 Achievements
This project passed all tests from `check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/outdated`, demonstrating its correctness and adherence to the project specifications.
