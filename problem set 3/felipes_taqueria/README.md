# 🎓 CS50 Python Programming Projects 🐍

Welcome to my CS50 Python Programming journey! This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Harvard University's CS50 Python course.

## 📚 Projects

### Felipe's Taqueria 🌮

#### 📂 Location
`problem set 3/felipes_taqueria/taqueria.py`

#### 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create a program that simulates an ordering system for Felipe's Taqueria, allowing users to place orders and calculating the total cost.

#### 📝 Description
This program prompts the user to input menu items one at a time, calculates the running total of the order, and displays the total cost after each item. It demonstrates dictionary usage, input handling, and formatted string output in Python.

#### 🔑 Key Features
- Implements a menu using a Python dictionary
- Prompts the user for menu items continuously
- Calculates and displays the running total after each item
- Handles case-insensitive input
- Ignores invalid menu items
- Formats the total cost to two decimal places with a dollar sign
- Ends input when the user presses control-d

#### 🖥️ How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "problem set 3/felipes_taqueria"
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   python taqueria.py
   ```
3. Enter menu items as prompted
4. Press control-d to finish the order

#### 🧪 Testing
You can test the program with various inputs:
- Try "Taco" twice → should output "Total: $6.00"
- Try "Baja Taco" then "Tortilla Salad" → should output "Total: $12.25"
- Try "Burger" → should reprompt without changing the total
- Try items with different casings → should work case-insensitively

#### 💡 What I Learned
- Working with dictionaries in Python
- Handling continuous user input
- Implementing case-insensitive string matching
- Formatting currency output
- Error handling for invalid inputs

#### 🏆 Achievements
This project passed all tests from `check50 cs50/problems/2022/python/taqueria`, demonstrating its correctness and adherence to the project specifications.
