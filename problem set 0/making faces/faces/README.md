# 🎓 CS50 Python Programming Projects 🐍

Welcome to my CS50 Python Programming journey! This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Harvard University's CS50 Python course.

## 📚 Projects

### 3. Making Faces 😊

#### 📂 Location
`problem set 0/making faces/faces/faces.py`

#### 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create a program that converts text-based emoticons to emoji, bringing old-school chatting into the modern era.

#### 📝 Description
Remember the days of :) and :( ? This program is a time machine for your text! It takes your input with classic emoticons and converts them into modern emoji, bridging the gap between text-based emotions and graphical expressions.

#### 🔑 Key Features
- Implements a `convert` function to transform emoticons to emoji
- Converts `:)` to 🙂 (slightly smiling face)
- Converts `:(` to 🙁 (slightly frowning face)
- Leaves all other text unchanged
- Includes a `main` function to handle user input and output

#### 🖥️ How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "problem set 0/making faces/faces"
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   python faces.py
   ```
3. Enter your text with emoticons when prompted
4. See your text transformed with modern emoji!

#### 🧪 Testing
You can test the program with various inputs:
- Try "Hello :)" → should output "Hello 🙂"
- Try "Goodbye :(" → should output "Goodbye 🙁"
- Try "Hello :) Goodbye :(" → should output "Hello 🙂 Goodbye 🙁"

#### 💡 What I Learned
- Creating and using functions in Python
- String manipulation and replacement
- Handling user input and output
- Basic emoji usage in Python strings
