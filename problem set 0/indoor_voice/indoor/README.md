# 🎓 CS50 Python Programming Projects 🐍

Welcome to my CS50 Python Programming journey! This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Harvard University's CS50 Python course.

## 📚 Projects

### 1. Indoor Voice 🤫

#### 📂 Location
`problem set 0/indoor_voice/indoor/indoor.py`

#### 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create a program that converts user input to lowercase, simulating an "indoor voice".

#### 📝 Description
In a world of caps lock and shouting, sometimes we need to tone it down. This program takes any input and converts it to a calm, lowercase output. It's like a digital "inside voice" reminder!

#### 🔑 Key Features
- Prompts user for input
- Converts the input to lowercase
- Preserves punctuation and whitespace
- Outputs the "quieter" version of the input

#### 🖥️ How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "problem set 0/indoor_voice/indoor"
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   python indoor.py
   ```
3. Enter your text when prompted
4. See your text transformed into its "indoor voice" version!

#### 🧪 Testing
You can test the program with various inputs:
- Try "HELLO" → should output "hello"
- Try "THIS IS CS50" → should output "this is cs50"
- Try "50" → should output "50"

#### 💡 What I Learned
- Working with user input in Python
- String manipulation and case conversion
- Preserving certain aspects of input while modifying others
