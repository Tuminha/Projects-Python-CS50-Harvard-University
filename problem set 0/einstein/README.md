# 🎓 CS50 Python Programming Projects 🐍

Welcome to my CS50 Python Programming journey! This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Harvard University's CS50 Python course.

## 📚 Projects

### 4. Einstein's E = mc² 🧠💡

#### 📂 Location
`problem set 0/einstein/einstein.py`

#### 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create a program that calculates the energy equivalent of a given mass using Einstein's famous equation E = mc².

#### 📝 Description
Ever wondered how much energy is packed into everyday objects? This program brings Einstein's groundbreaking equation to life! It takes a mass input in kilograms and calculates the equivalent energy in Joules. It's like having a pocket-sized particle accelerator! 🚀

#### 🔑 Key Features
- Prompts the user for mass input in kilograms
- Calculates energy using the formula E = mc²
- Assumes the speed of light (c) is approximately 300,000,000 meters per second
- Outputs the equivalent energy in Joules as an integer

#### 🖥️ How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "problem set 0/einstein"
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   python einstein.py
   ```
3. Enter the mass in kilograms when prompted
4. See the mind-blowing amount of energy equivalent!

#### 🧪 Testing
You can test the program with various inputs:
- Try "1" → should output "90000000000000000"
- Try "14" → should output "1260000000000000000"
- Try "50" → should output "4500000000000000000"

#### 💡 What I Learned
- Working with mathematical formulas in Python
- Handling user input for numerical calculations
- Using exponents and large numbers in Python
- Formatting output for readability

#### 🤓 Fun Fact
Did you know? The energy calculated by this program is equivalent to the amount released if all the mass were converted directly into energy. That's why nuclear reactions, which convert a tiny fraction of mass to energy, can be so powerful!
