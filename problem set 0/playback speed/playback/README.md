# 🎓 CS50 Python Programming Projects 🐍

Welcome to my CS50 Python Programming journey! This repository contains my solutions and projects for the Harvard University's CS50 Python course.

## 📚 Projects

### 2. Playback Speed 🐢

#### 📂 Location
`problem set 0/playback/playback/playback.py`

#### 🎯 Goal
The goal of this project is to create a program that simulates slowing down speech by replacing spaces with periods, mimicking a slower playback speed.

#### 📝 Description
Ever wished you could slow down a fast talker? This program does just that! It takes any input and adds dramatic pauses (in the form of periods) between each word, giving you that satisfying slow-motion effect.

#### 🔑 Key Features
- Prompts user for input
- Replaces each space with three periods (`...`)
- Outputs the "slowed down" version of the input

#### 🖥️ How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd "problem set 0/playback/playback"
   ```
2. Run the program:
   ```
   python playback.py
   ```
3. Enter your text when prompted
4. See your text transformed into its "slowed down" version!

#### 🧪 Testing
You can test the program with various inputs:
- Try "This is CS50" → should output "This...is...CS50"
- Try "This is our week on functions" → should output "This...is...our...week...on...functions"
- Try "Let's implement a function called hello" → should output "Let's...implement...a...function...called...hello"

#### 💡 What I Learned
- String manipulation in Python
- Working with user input
- Replacing specific characters in strings
